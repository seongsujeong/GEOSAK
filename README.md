# GEOSAK - GEOSpatial Abstraction and toolKit

1. What
    - This is a collection of small codes that simplify the data manipulation of Geospatial data using GDAL and OSGEO.

2. Why
    - GDAL and OSGeo softwares provide very useful and reliable ways of playing with geospatial data.
    - On top of these, the codes in GEOSAK is aimed to provide further simplified way of using the packages when playing with the data.

3. Components
    - [GRWT](markdown/grwt.md) : GDAL Raster Wrapper and Toolkit
    - [visualizer](markdown/visualizer.md) : A set of raster visualization routines to simple-check how the raster look like
    - [VIRASTILE](virastile.md) : Virtual Raster tile. To be used for tile-based processing. Currently under development.
    - New modules/codes planned.

4. How to use
    - Make sure you have GDAL and its python modules installed. It can be easily installed by using conda.
    - Just clone or download the codes, and add the path to $PYTHONPATH. That's it!
